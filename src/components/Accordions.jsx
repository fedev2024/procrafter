            A resume builder is an app or software program anyone can use to quickly and easily make resumes, cover letters and CVs. Many sites, including , offer a resume builder service to help you through every resume section, offering tips and guidance along the way. Builders automate parts of the resume-writing process using AI to generate text suggestions based on your work experience. For example, someone who worked in retail would type in their previous job title to get dozens of auto-generated work experience bullet points. They could then edit the text to make it more specific and showcase their unique contributions.Additionally, you can use a free resume builder or a premium one. With a premium builder, you’ll have more download options. When you finish your competitive resume in just a few minutes, you can download the resume in any file format you like.

An ATS is software that scans resumes, screens them for critical information — such as specific skills and experience — and eliminates unqualified applicants.In addition to offering ATS-friendly templates, our builder’s prewritten content suggestions help you choose the critical keywords employers look for in top candidates for your specific job title. Available in our Resume Builder, these content suggestions make it quick and easy to build a strong resume. We also offer Microsoft Word and Google Doc resume templates that are ATS-compatible.

            Yes! The best way to get your resume through an ATS is to customize it for every role you apply to.Study the job description to understand which skills are critical to that specific role and then update your resume accordingly, focusing on the professional summary or resume objective, the skills section and the bullet points in your work experience section. Customizing your resume doesn’t take long and can help set you apart from the competition, helping you land an interview.
